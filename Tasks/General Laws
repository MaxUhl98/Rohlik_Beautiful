1. You can only work on a new task once the previous task has been completed beautifully,
which means that the code has to be  generalized, has to have low complexity and a test coverage of at least 85%
2. You have to use version control to save the different configurations for test runs
3. If a certain piece of code outside of model training/openfe takes longer than 5 seconds you have to optimize it
4. Configuration files should be as simple as possible
