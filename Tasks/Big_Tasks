0. Setup automatic commits, automatically calculated complexity, automatically calculated code coverage,
1. Setup stable, reproducible, project emulating CV, which automatically saves oof predictions for later use
- includes logging
- includes automated saving of test settings, produced models and adding the experiment results to an aggregated view
- setup reproducible config file that is automatically committed during a pipeline run
2. Implement preprocessing pipeline which fits neatly into the CV schema
3. Include option for feature selection (SFS/feature importance)
4. Implement model selection in a way to perfectly fit into the existing pipeline
5. Write a hyperparameter-tuning wrapper for the pipeline
6. Add automated ensembling using oof predictions as last step
7. Automate Submitting (make submitting to kaggle optional)
8. Conduct Automated tests
9. Optimize
