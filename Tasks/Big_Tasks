[x] 0. Setup automatically calculated complexity, automatically calculated code coverage
[x] 1. Setup stable, reproducible, project emulating CV, which automatically saves oof predictions for later use
        - includes logging
        - includes automated saving of test settings, produced models and adding the experiment results to an aggregated view
[ ] 2. Implement preprocessing pipeline which fits neatly into the CV schema
        - setup reproducible config file whose settings are logged and saved during each pipeline run
[ ] 3. Include option for feature selection (SFS/feature importance)
[ ] 4. Implement model selection in a way to perfectly fit into the existing pipeline
[ ] 5. Write a hyperparameter-tuning wrapper for the pipeline
[ ] 6. Add automated ensemble using oof predictions as last step
[ ] 7. Automate Submitting (make submitting to kaggle optional)
[ ] 8. Conduct Automated tests of different models, configs, tuning setups etc.
[ ] 9. Optimize
